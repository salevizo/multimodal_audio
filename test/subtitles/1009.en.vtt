Hi Sri. Thanks for taking a few minutes to talk to us today.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
When you're talking to your customers, what's top of mind for them these days?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
5G is top of mind. 5G is now.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
5G is front and center, compared to a year ago.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
5G, what does it mean, in terms of network architecture?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What the business models are?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What kind of applications will be enabled thanks to 5G?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Is it AR, VR, is it gaming? Is it massive sensors?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
All of those are things that our customers are looking at.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And how has the landscape changed in the past year?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Security is something that is

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
significantly more important compared to even a year ago.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You see a lot of news articles, whether it is Facebook privacy issues

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
or some of the DDoS attacks.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So customers are worried about how to make their networks more robust,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
more security proof.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Just doing perimeter security is not enough.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Firewalls are not enough.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And they're looking to see how to protect

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
bad actors from within the network.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So that's front and center.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Have you seen any change in the adoption of 5G by our customers?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
They're all getting ready to deploy.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
More in pockets of the world.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Definitely in the U.S. And the two Olympic countries, in Korea and in Japan.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And also in some parts of the world where big cities,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
take London, Northern Dubai,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
you see quite a few places where there is very active planning going on.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And some of our customers are also

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
very serious about being first to market,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
it's significant from a marketing perspective.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And so, we do expect to see deployments happen by the end of the year.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Also remember 5G is not just radio. It's also the entire network

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
to enable some of the applications that are coming on with 5G,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
the need to think of the network end to end.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Now, we introduced the FP4 silicon last year and several FP4-based products,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and customers are in trial with those now.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
What kind of feedback are you getting on those?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Exceptional! We publicly announced that we have over 60 trials on FP4.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Every single trial that we've done so far has gone exceptionally well.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
There is very heavy demand for our products to be shipped,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
for products to continue expanding the trials that we have.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And they are excited about the features that we are enabling,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
effectively, flexibility without any compromises.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And so we couldn't be more proud and excited about our FP4 launch.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Nice. Well thanks for taking a few minutes to talk to us today.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.600
Sure. Thank you. 
Thanks.
