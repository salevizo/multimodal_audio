00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.640
How does he work his... Why are his shoulders
so strong looking? Because they're very defined

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.470
for a man. How does he do that? I should do
that.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:14.060
What? Do I have incredibly defined shoulders?
I always think they're quite rounded. I'll

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.860
take it.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.300
He was doing this. I think he thinks they're
quite stacked.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.480
Honestly, I don't know where that's come from.
But thanks Max for that.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.440
Yeah, I don't...

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:37.020
I go to the gym, I guess. I swim a lot, which
I think won't harm me. Yeah, I don't know.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.780
I was born with this. This is my mum and dad's
genes. My mum has incredibly large shoulders.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.240
And my question for Doug?

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.140
What's his morning routine? Like when he wakes
up in the morning, what's the first thing

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.589
he does and the last thing he does? You know,
before he has to leave the house.

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:02.530
I'd be intrigued to know. He must use some
sort of incredible moisturiser. But you know,

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.390
he always looks flawless.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:11.160
Thanks Sam. What is my morning routine? Sort
of pull myself out of bed, jump in the shower,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.300
have a bowl of cereal, run out the door - normally
ten minutes late. That's my routine.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:26.159
How did they survive working with ten overly
excited boys for two months and survive and

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.220
come out of it still liking us? I think that's
quite a good question. How did they possibly

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.960
do that?

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.300
-We didn't.
-No.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.200
Why do you think we're doing the interviews
together and not with the boys?

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.140
They're in a different hotel.

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.709
We won't even be near them.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.720
Because they're all just so lovely and funny.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.380
Yeah.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.820
And I still feel like I like them a little
bit, even when I watch the film actually.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:57.220
Yeah, I think... Because you know sort of
like all of those moments, and then you stop,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.260
and they're just silly and ridiculous and
lovely. So I find it's quite hard to separate that.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.000
There was a moment actually in the scene when
all the boys are like... When it gets far

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.910
too close to sexual abuse with Lauren. There
was a moment when Doug put his hand on me

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.830
in between takes, and went are you alright,
Holly? And I was um...

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.090
Actually don't.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.180
In a bit.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.960
In a bit, in a bit.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.220
When we're off set.
